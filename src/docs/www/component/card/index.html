<p class="lead">
    Cards are used to collect and highlight short pieces of content
</p>

<h2>Intended behaviour</h2>

<p>
    Cards allow for the display of a wide variety of content using a range of display options.
</p>

<p>
    Cards best support browsing for information rather than close reading.
</p>

<h2>When to use this component</h2>

<p>
    Browsing is a large part of interaction, and users want to be able to quickly scan large
    portions of content and dive deep into their interests. Users can experience difficulty
    browsing text-heavy sites as displaying extra details for each item can clutter the screen
    and prevent efficient scanning.
</p>

<p>
    Cards are great for showcasing aggregated elements whose size or supported actions vary.
    Each card serves as an entry point to more detailed information, so it shouldn't be
    overloaded with extraneous information or actions.
</p>

<p>
    Cards allow you to present a heavy dose of content in a small and digestible manner: they
    divide all available content into meaningful sections, present a summary and optionally a link to
    additional details. A single card is a container that displays various parts of related
    information, from which users can get even more information.
</p>

<h2>When not to use this component</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Strict order</strong>. When you have a strict order in which you want users to
    scan the content. Card layouts typically deemphasize ranking of content as they don't
    provide obvious information about the order in which content should be viewed on a page.
    As a result, there's little hierarchy in the visual information presented. Cards can make
    all content look similar, which can make it hard (or even impossible) for users to easily
    discern the ranking importance of content.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Image</h3>

{% set code %}
{% raw %}
{{ card({
    'heading': 'Card Title',
    'content': 'This is a card with an image above and supporting text below.',
    'image': 'https://www.nihr.ac.uk/images/health-and-social-care-professionals/engagement-and-participation/people-at-meeting.jpg'
}) }}
{% endraw %}

            'code': code
        }
    ]

<h3>Heading only</h3>

{% set code %}
