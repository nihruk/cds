    popularity.

  <h2>Intended behaviour</h2>

  <p>
    Filters narrow down results by common characteristics such as price, colour, or
    popularity. However, we should also include filters that vary according to the category or
    page the user is on.Category-specific filters also have the advantage of being an
    education point for people who have less experience with the content being displayed.
    Decisions might not be taken based on a single data point. Whether we know exactly what we
    want (we're interested in a restaurant that has tables outside, and allows pets, and has
    vegetarian options), or we only know what we don't want (we're not interested in a
    restaurant with loud music), it makes sense to allow for multiple filters to be selected
    at once. This will allow the user to narrow down their search quickly and more
    comfortably.
  </p>

  <p>
    Allowing multiple selections also works better for slower connections. It is frustrating
    to have the intention of selecting two or more filters, only to see the page reload
    painstakingly slow with each selection.

  <h2>When to use this component</h2>
  <p>
    When you want a user to narrow down high volumes of content and to surface the most
    relevant results.
