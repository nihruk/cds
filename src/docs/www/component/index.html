        Components are the building blocks of the Design System. Quickly combined, they shape up to entire pages and
        applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Design System offers components for content presentation and navigation, to collect data, and more. Each
        component features code and interactive examples, and if you have <a href="/get-started/install">installed</a>
        the Design System, you can use the provided HTML and <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>
        examples verbatim.
