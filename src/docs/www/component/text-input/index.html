  <p>
    Text inputs are used when you need to let users enter text that’s no longer than a
    single line, such as their name or phone number.
  </p>

  <h2>Intended behaviour</h2>

  <p>All text inputs must have labels, and in most cases the label should be visible.</p>
  <p>
    You should align labels above the text input they refer to. They should be short, direct
    and written in sentence case. Do not use colons at the end of labels.
  </p>
  <p>Avoid placeholder text</p>
  <p>Do not use placeholder text in place of a label, or for hints or examples, as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      it vanishes when the user starts typing, which can cause problems for users with memory
      conditions or when reviewing answers
    </li>
    <li>not all screen readers read it out</li>
    <li>its browser default styles often do not meet minimum contrast requirements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you’re asking one question on the page</p>
  <p>
    If you’re asking just one question per page as recommended, you can set the contents of
    the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that
    users of screen readers will only hear the contents once. Use appropriately-sized text
    inputs
  </p>
  <p>
    Help users understand what they should enter by making text inputs the right size for the
    content they're intended for.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, the width of text inputs is fluid and will fit the full width of the container
    they are placed into.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to make the input smaller, you can either use a fixed width input, or use the
    width override classes to create a smaller, fluid width input.
  </p>
  <p>Fixed width inputs</p>
  <p>
    Use fixed width inputs for content that has a specific, known length. Postcode inputs
    should be postcode-sized, telephone number inputs should be telephone number-sized.
  </p>
  <p>
    The widths are designed for specific character lengths and to be consistent across a range
    of browsers. They include extra padding to fit icons that some browsers might insert into
    the input (for example to show or generate a password).
  </p>
  <p>
    On fixed width inputs, the width will remain fixed on all screens unless it is wider than
    the viewport, in which case it will shrink to fit.

  <h2>When to use this component</h2>

  <p>
    Use the text input component when you need to let users enter text that’s no longer than a
    single line, such as their name or phone number.
  </p>

  <h2>When not to use this component</h2>

  <p>
    Do not use the text input component if you need to let users enter longer answers that
    might span multiple lines. In this case, you should use the textarea component.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <div class="component-wrapper bg-white p-3">
    <div class="mb-3">
      <label for="exampleFormControlInput1" class="form-label">Label</label>
      <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlInput1" placeholder="" />
    </div>
  </div>
