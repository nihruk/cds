  <p>
    Form select lists are used when the user has a choice of many options eg choosing a
    country or a county
  </p>

  <h2>Intended behaviour</h2>
  <p>
    If you use the component for settings, you can make an option pre-selected by default when
    users first see it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use the component for questions, you should not pre-select any of the options in
    case it influences usersâ€™ answers.
  </p>
  <h2>When to use this component</h2>

  <p>
    The select component allows users to choose an option from a long list. The select
    component should only be used as a last resort in public-facing services because research
    shows that some users find selects very difficult to use.
  </p>
  <h2>When not to use this component</h2>
  <p>
    The select component allows users to choose an option from a long list. Before using the
    select component, try asking users questions which will allow you to present them with
    fewer options.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  {% set code %}
    <select class="form-select" aria-label="Default select example">
      <option selected>Open this select menu</option>
      <option value="1">One</option>
      <option value="2">Two</option>
      <option value="3">Three</option>
    </select>
  {% endset %}
  {% include 'partials/html-example.html' %}
