    Alerts are status messages shown to the user, embedded in a page, and sometimes
    but not always about that page.
  </p>

  <h2>Intended behaviour</h2>

  <p>
    Common colours for these messages are green for success, yellow/orange/amber for warning,
    red for error, and blue for info. These colours are merely a convention, and we must
    choose our own colours and shades that communicate intent and are accessible to all users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, to facilitate colourblind users, alerts must have a second visual
    identifier that communicates the messageâ€™s intent with more than mere colour (shape or
    text).
  </p>

  <h2>When to use this component</h2>

  <p>
    Common statuses include success to inform about a user action that completed successfully,
    warning to tell users that they should be aware of something, error for user or server
    actions that went wrong and could not be completed, or info for messages that are
    informational but not otherwise important.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  {% set code %}
    {{ alert({
      'type': 'info',
      'body': 'Updates are available'
    }) }}
    {{ alert({
      'type': 'success',
      'body': 'Updates were made successfully'
    }) }}
    {{ alert({
      'type': 'warning',
      'body': 'Updates have not been run recently'
    }) }}
    {{ alert({
      'type': 'danger',
      'body': 'An error occurred while updating'
    }) }}
