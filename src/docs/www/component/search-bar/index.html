    The search bar is a common component across NIHR services
  </p>

  <h2>Intended behaviour</h2>
  <p>
    A search bar is usually made up of two UI elements: an input field, and a button. However,
    the design of a search bar has a significant effect on how fast users can find the
    information that they are looking for on your site.

  <h2>When to use this component</h2>

  <p>
    The thinking and psychology behind search bar use is that it helps users find information
    quickly. Search bars are useful in complex content-heavy sites that have more than 100
    pages. In the Business to Consumer (B2C) sector, search bars are used in large e-commerce
    sites, news sites, deals sites, and booking sites to help users find information easily.
    They are also used in large Business to Business (B2B) sites that have many customer
    segments and product lines. If you have a small site that has few pages, a search bar
    might not be required but you will need it as the site grows.

  <h2>When not to use this component</h2>

      >Smaller websites are better without search</a
    >. When a site has a limited amount of content (e.g. fewer than 100-200 pages), thereâ€™s no
    need for search.
