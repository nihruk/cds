  <p class="lead">Use the grid system to lay out the content on your service's pages.</p>
  <p>
    Most NIHR pages serving text content follow a <i>two-thirds</i> or <i>two-thirds and one-third</i> layout, where the
    main content is always displayed in the two-thirds column. The optional one-third column is for secondary content or
    navigation. This stops lines of text getting so long that the page becomes difficult to read on desktop devices.
    This would usually mean no more than 75 characters per line.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the Design System allows for other layouts if your type of service needs it.
  </p>

  <h2>The grid system</h2>
  <p>
    The Design System builds layouts using Bootstrap's <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/">grid
    system</a>. Grids are containers that contain rows that contain columns (cells). Each cell in each row and column
    can be sized and positioned within the grid.
  </p>

  <h2>Screen size</h2>
  <p>
    Design for small screens first, starting with a single-column layout.
  </p>
  <p>
    Never make assumptions about what devices people are using. Design for different screen
    sizes rather than specific devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    The default maximum page width is 1440px, but you can make it wider if your content
    requires it.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Layouts</h2>
  <h3>Two-thirds</h3>
  {% set code %}
      {% include 'docs/partials/style/layout/two-thirds.html' %}
  {% endset %}
  {% include 'docs/partials/html-example.html' %}

  <h3>Two-thirds and one-third</h3>
  {% set code %}
      {% include 'docs/partials/style/layout/two-thirds--one-third.html' %}
  {% endset %}
  {% include 'docs/partials/html-example.html' %}
