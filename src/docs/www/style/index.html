        Use these styles to make your application fit in with the NIHR ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Design System for the NIHR styles can be implemented in any web application, regardless of technology stack.
        They serve as blueprints for your own implementations, as well as the basis for
        <a href="/component">component</a> designs.
    </p>
    <p>
        After <a href="/get-started/install">installing</a> and importing the Design System, these styles will be
        available and applied to your application out of the box. These implementations are built on top of
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and provide
        <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> macros.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your web application uses different technologies, you can implement these styles as well as the components
        yourself on top of a framework of your choice.
