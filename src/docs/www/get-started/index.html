    <p class="lead">
        The <i>Design System for the NIHR</i> is a collection of style guidelines for designing and branding NIHR web
        applications, on how to design content and interaction, as well as a set of tools to quickly build your own
        applications following these guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="/style">Styles</a> section documents the guidelines, ranging from branding, to colour, to text, to
        content presentation. These apply to all applications that must implement NIHR corporate branding.
    </p>
    <p>
        Built on top of the style guidelines are the <a href="/component">components</a>, which are concrete bits of
        HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript that fulfil a specific purpose, and that can be reused throughout your
        application like building bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may choose to implement the Design System's style guidelines using your own technology stack. Alternatively,
        you can <a href="/get-started/install">install the Design System</a> into your project, and reuse our own
        component implementations that are based on <a href="getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The entire Design System ecosystem is built using code, including the style guidelines, this documentation site,
        and the Bootstrap implementations of our components. Find us on Github under
        <a href="https://github.com/nihruk/design-system">nihruk/design-system</a>.
