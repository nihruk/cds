        <i>npm</i> is a JavaScript package manager that handles the installation and updates of third-party software,
        including the Design System for the NIHR.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> 18 or newer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        On your command line, from your project's root directory, run <code>npm install @nihruk/design-system</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This installs the Design System's source and distribution code into your project, where you can import only
        those parts you need.
    </p>

    {% set code %}
        @import '~@nihruk/design-system/dist/design-system.bundle.css';
    {% endset %}
    <pre class="example-code p-3">{{ code | prettier('css') | highlight('css') | safe }}</pre>
    {% set code %}
        import '~@nihruk/design-system/dist/design-system.bundle.js';
    {% endset %}
    <pre class="example-code p-3">{{ code | prettier('babel') | highlight('js') | safe }}</pre>

    <h2>Bundling your application</h2>
    <p>
        Before your application can be published for the web, it must be bundled. The Design System uses SCSS and newer
        EcmaScript features that must be transpiled before use. Additionally, bundlers such as <i>Browserify</i>,
        <i>gulp</i>, or <i>Webpack</i> are often able to skip parts of your code base and its dependencies that are not
        needed in your bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
        How to choose and configure a bundler depends on your team and your project, and is outside the scope of the
        Design System. For example, the Design System documentation site you are currently reading was bundled using
        Bootstrap's <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/webpack/#configure-webpack">Webpack
        configuration guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>When to install using npm</h2>
    <p>
        You should install the Design System using npm if you need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>reduce the bundle size and bandwidth usage</li>
        <li>override SCSS variables</li>
        <li>host all assets yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alternative package managers</h2>
    <p>
        Any package manager that uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm Registry</a> is supported, but exact instructions may vary.
