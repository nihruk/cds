  <h2>Screen size</h2>

  <p>Design for small screens first, starting with a single-column layout.</p>
  <p>
    For most types of page, we recommend using either a ‘two-thirds’ or a ‘two-thirds and
    one-third’ layout. That stops lines of text getting so long that the page becomes
    difficult to read on desktop devices. This would usually mean no more than 75 characters
    per line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Never make assumptions about what devices people are using. Design for different screen
    sizes rather than specific devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    The default maximum page width is 1440px, but you can make it wider if your content
    requires it.

  <h2 class="mt-5">Grid system</h2>
  <p>Use the grid system to lay out the content on your service’s pages.</p>
  <p>
    Most GOV.UK pages follow a ‘two-thirds and one-third’ layout and we aim to follow that,
    but the grid system allows for a number of additional combinations when necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your main content should always be in a two-thirds column even if you’re not using a
    corresponding one-third column for secondary content.
  </p>
  <h3>Understanding the grid system</h3>

  <p>
    The grid is structured with a wrapper which acts as a row to contain your grid columns.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can add columns inside this wrapper to create your layout. To define your columns …

  <p>The available widths are:</p>
