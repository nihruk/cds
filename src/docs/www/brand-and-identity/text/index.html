  <h2>Intended behaviour</h2>

  <h3>Headings</h3>

  <p>Write all headings in sentence case.</p>
  <p>
    Use heading tags, such as h1, h2 and so on, to tag the headings on a page. Apply a heading
    class, such as govuk-heading-l, to style them visually. Style headings consistently to
    create a clear content structure throughout your service.
  </p>

  <h3>Paragraphs</h3>

  <h4>Body</h4>
  <p>The default paragraph font size is 22px on large screens and 16px on small screens.</p>
  <h4>Bold text</h4>
  <p>
    You can use bold to emphasize particular words in a transaction. Use it to highlight
    critical information that users need to refer to or you’ve seen them miss.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, “Your reference number is ABC12345678. Use this to track your application.
    Updates will be sent to name@example.com“
  </p>
  <p>
    Use bold sparingly. Overuse will make it difficult for users to know which parts of your
    content they need to pay the most attention to.
  </p>
  <h4>Links</h4>
  <p>
    Links are blue and underlined by default. If your link is at the end of a sentence or
    paragraph, make sure that the linked text does not include the full stop.
