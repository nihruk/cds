  <h2>Using our NIHR typeface</h2>

  <p>
    Lato is our corporate typeface family - an open source (free) collection of typefaces
    alongside Google and the Sans Serif collection. There are ten variations of the Lato
    typeface selected as part of NIHR's visual identity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lato-Regular and Lato-Light work well for display copy and body text for print-on-demand
    or digital documents and the Web. Lato-Black can be used for headings and subheadings.
    Lato-Hairline may be used for decorative and formal purposes, such as invitations to
    special events. Lato-Hairline is not to be used as body text or in all caps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bold and Italic variations of the typefacescan be used as described in NIHR’s
    <a href="https://www.comms.nihr.ac.uk/content/written-content/a-z-style-guide.htm"
      >style guide</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lato is the typeface of choice when designing websites and when designing print-on-demand
    and digital communication materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arial is to be used as a generic typeface back-up. If Lato is not available, Arial can be
    used for correspondence, business documents and emails. Arial can also be used when
    writing on external web platforms, such as Eventbrite.
  </p>
  <p>The recommended font size for text is 16 points.</p>

  <p>Spacing is everything in UI design.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It improves data consumption through better legibility</li>
    <li>It provides customers with a more consistent user experience</li>
    <li>It eliminates guesswork and decision fatigue whilst designing and developing</li>
    <li>It drives consistent scalability</li>
    <li>It conveys meaning by giving elements a visual hierarchy</li>
    <li>If you’re a designer, your output will just… look better.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To begin, set out base numbers for your grid. We use material design principles so
    divisions of 8: 8px / 16px / 24px / 32px / 40px / 48px / 56px and so on for all padding /
    margin between elements (sometimes 4px if you need to go in tight).
  </p>

  <p>
    So the layout for a set of elelments; H1, p tag, text/input field and cta could be
    vertically like this
  </p>

  <img
    src="{{webRoot}}/_docs_assets/images/brand-and-identity/typography/1.png"
    alt=""
    class="img-fluid mt-3s component-wrapper"
  />

  <p>You can see that the line heights, heights and all spacing is scaled by 8</p>

  <img
    src="{{webRoot}}/_docs_assets/images/brand-and-identity/typography/scale.png"
    alt=""
    class="img-fluid mt-3s component-wrapper"
  />

  <br />

  <img
    src="{{webRoot}}/_docs_assets/images/brand-and-identity/typography/line heights.png"
    alt=""
    class="img-fluid mt-3s component-wrapper"
  />

  <img
    src="{{webRoot}}/_docs_assets/images/brand-and-identity/typography/paragraphs.png"
    alt=""
    class="img-fluid mt-3s component-wrapper"
  />

  <p>These are the font values for mobile and desktop with vertical rhythm applied</p>
