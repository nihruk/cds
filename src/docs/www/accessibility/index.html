                    Use <i>NIHR Yellow</i> to indicate that an element on the page is currently focused. You should
                    apply the colour liberally, so your users cannot miss the focused element when visually scanning the
                    page. Possible ways to style a focused element are through a yellow background, or a
                    <a href="/style/border">border or outline</a>.
