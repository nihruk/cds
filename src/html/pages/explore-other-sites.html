        <p>Cards are better suited when users browse for information than when they search.</p>

        <p>
          Cards work best for collections of heterogeneous items (when not all the content is of the
          same basic type). When to use this component

          Browsing is a large part of interaction, and users want to be able to quickly scan large
          portions of content and dive deep into their interests. Users can experience difficulty
          browsing text-heavy sites as displaying extra details for each item can clutter the screen
          and prevent efficient scanning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cards are great for showcasing aggregated elements whose size or supported actions vary.
          Each card serves as an entry point to more detailed information, so it shouldn’t be
          overloaded with extraneous information or actions. They are dismissible, swipeable,
          sortable, and filterable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cards allow you to present a heavy dose of content in a small and digestible manner: they
          divide all available content into meaningful sections, present a summary and link to
          additional details. A single card is a container that displays various parts of related
          information, from which users can get even more information.
        </p>
        <h2>When not to use this component</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Strict order</strong>. When you have a strict order in which you want users to
          scan the content. Card layouts typically deemphasize ranking of content as they don’t
          provide obvious information about the order in which content should be viewed on a page.
          As a result, there’s little hierarchy in the visual information presented. Cards can make
          all content look similar, which can make it hard (or even impossible) for users to easily
          discern the ranking importance of content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Do not use on the Corporate site unless you are signposting content on another service
            site such as Journals Library and Funding & Awards.
