        <h1>Flash Messages</h1>

        <p>
          Flash messages are status messages shown to the user, embedded in a page, and sometimes
          but not always about that page.
        </p>

        <h2>Intended behaviour</h2>

        <p>
          Flash messages are status messages shown to the user, embedded in a page, and sometimes
          but not always about that page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common colours for these messages are green for success, yellow/orange/amber for warning,
          red for error, and blue for info. These colours are merely a convention, and we must
          choose our own colours and shades that communicate intent and are accessible to all users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, to facilitate colourblind users, flash messages must have a second visual
          identifier that communicates the message’s intent with more than mere colour (shape or
          text).
        </p>

        <h2>When to use this component</h2>

        <p>
          Common statuses include success to inform about a user action that completed successfully,
          warning to tell users that they should be aware of something, error for user or server
          actions that went wrong and could not be completed, or info for messages that are
          informational but not otherwise important.
        </p>

        <h2>When not to use this component</h2>
