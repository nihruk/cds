        <h1>Search filters</h1>

        <p>
          Search filters narrow down results by common characteristics such as price, colour, or
          popularity.

        <h4>Intended behaviou</h4>

        <p>
          Filters narrow down results by common characteristics such as price, colour, or
          popularity. However, we should also include filters that vary according to the category or
          page the user is on.Category-specific filters also have the advantage of being an
          education point for people who have less experience with the content being displayed.
          Decisions might not be taken based on a single data point. Whether we know exactly what we
          want (we're interested in a restaurant that has tables outside, and allows pets, and has
          vegetarian options), or we only know what we don't want (we're not interested in a
          restaurant with loud music), it makes sense to allow for multiple filters to be selected
          at once. This will allow the user to narrow down their search quickly and more
          comfortably.
        </p>

        <p>
          Allowing multiple selections also works better for slower connections. It is frustrating
          to have the intention of selecting two or more filters, only to see the page reload
          painstakingly slow with each selection.
        </p>

        <h4>When to use this component</h4>
        <p>
          When you want a user to narrow down high volumes of content and to surface the most
          relevant results.
        </p>

        <h4>When not to use this component</h4>
        <p>If the above criteria isn't met.</p>
